# Local Configuration for Vim

All you need to do is curl the install script for this repository and run it
using bash and it will take care of installing everything for you.

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0-f0x/vim-config/master/install.sh | bash
```

The configuration will link a vimrc for regular old vim. It will also install
vim-plug as the plugin manager and link an nvim init file.
